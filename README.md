## Why Ie created this website?
To demonstrate my skills, abilities, and accomplishments. Starting a portfolio is the first step for professionals to do in order to get involved in work environment. Through the Coding course, I managed to do my first fine simple portfolio.

Hope you like it y'all! ^.^

## How I created it?
<hr>
Throughout the developing process of the Portfolio project, I have practiced the following:
<br>
Git & Github
HTML5 & CSS
Responsive Web Design

And we've earned a noticeable experience in GitHub workflow. Each developer has worked individually and divided his project into tasks with a limited time to finish.
